chef-varnish-dashboard
======================

A chef recipe for the amazing Varnish Agent Dashboard (A real time Varnish Cache metrics dashboard)

Requirements
------------

You just need to add the ```varnish``` recipe (https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/varnish)
and make sure you will install varnish 3.0 or higher by updating the attributes.rb file:

```ruby 
#default['varnish']['version'] = "2.1"
default['varnish']['version'] = "3.0"
```

What does this recipe do?
-------------------------

1) Install automatically the Varnish Agent 2 (*), a small daemon meant to communicate with 
Varnish and other varnish-related services to allow remote control and monitoring of Varnish

2) Clone the Varnish Dashboard project (from @pbruna) (**)

3) Execute the Varnish Agent pointing to the Dashboard project.
